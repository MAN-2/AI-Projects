## 🔮 Future Scope & Enhancements
### **🔊 Voice Functionality**
Currently, the chatbot operates via text. A future upgrade could integrate **voice-based interaction**, allowing users to:
- **Ask resume-related questions via speech** instead of typing.
- **Receive spoken responses** using a text-to-speech engine.
- **Streamline accessibility** for users who prefer voice-based career assistance.

Libraries like **SpeechRecognition** and **pyttsx3** can be incorporated for voice interaction.

Known Error :: ** Can sometimes run duplicate instances of Streamlit UI and present multiple dialogs on first deployment .
